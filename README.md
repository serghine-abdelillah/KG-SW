# Tourism Knowledge Graph Web Interface

This project implements a semantic Knowledge Graph (KG) for tourism using RDF/Turtle and provides a web interface to explore it, similar to Wikidata.  
The interface allows users to browse hotels, view details, and access related entities like cities, tourists, and reviews.
